# Repo for a Workshop on DevOps Tools

The repo contains all necessary data to teach a workshop on modern DevOps / Cloud Engineering tools.

You can do the following:

1. Create Infrastructure as Code (IAC) with Terraform and Amazon Web Services (AWS)
2. Dockerize an app (e.g. React or GatsbyJS)
3. Set up a CI/CD pipeline with Travis CI on AWS

## Administration

Executing the script will create users in an AWS Account. You can also delete them by calling the appropriate function.

## App

Contains a very simple app to test the pipeline.

## Infrastructure

Contains sample code for an infrastructure deployment on AWS.

## Presentation

A reveal.js presentation is provided which serves the purpose of a guideline for the workshop. It is located on http://capstone-pres.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/
